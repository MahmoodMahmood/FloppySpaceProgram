# FloppySpaceProgram
This is my 12th grade final project

The project was written in Java using LIBGDX and it should be functional on Dekstop, Android, IOS and HTML (although I only tested Desktop and Android)

This is a tap game where the objective of the game is to get as many birds flying in the air at the same time.

WARNING: This game causes significant addiction and loss of humanity, play at your own risk
